    "Full Stack Developer's diet: Coffee for breakfast, debugging for lunch, and more coffee for dinner.",
    "AI is like a toddler—cute, but you never know what it's going to do next."
    "I asked my AI for a joke, and it gave me a 5-minute monologue on data ethics."

"Why did the AI break up with its algorithm? It found someone with better processing power."

"I tried explaining machine learning to my cat... now it’s demanding a training dataset."

"IoT devices are like kids—they always want your attention, but when you need them, they're offline."

"Debugging is like being a detective in a criminal movie where you are also the murderer."

"Full Stack Developer: because who needs sleep when you can fix bugs at 3 a.m.?"

"AI is like a car—you’re never sure if it’s going to get you to your destination or take you on a detour."

"My machine learning model is so good, it already predicted I would get this joke."

"IoT: When your devices are smarter than your WiFi router."

"Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs."

"AI thinks it's the next big thing—until it tries to explain itself to a human."

"Machine learning: When your algorithm knows more about you than your therapist."

"IoT security: because even your fridge needs a firewall now."

"If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in."

"Full Stack Developer’s checklist: Fix the backend, break the frontend, fix the frontend, break the backend."

"I gave my AI a list of tasks, but it only returned a recursive function error."

"Full Stack Developer's favorite programming language: Whatever gets the job done by deadline."

"My AI is great at playing chess... but it can’t figure out how to set an alarm for 7 AM."

"Cybersecurity is like a good password: Everyone knows it’s important, but no one wants to do it."

"Why do developers love the cloud? Because it’s just one big excuse for their code to go ‘up there’."

"I gave my IoT device a personality. Now it’s texting me more than my friends."

"Debugging in machine learning is just adding ‘print’ statements until it works."
